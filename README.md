# Cloudurity Intership Assessments

## Python Test Set - 1

- Create a microblogging site (like twitter) that allows only text posts, with a max character limit of 150 characters.

- Users can create new posts, reply to existing posts and like existing posts.

- The UI can be very minimal to allow posting, replying, liking for authenticated users and viewing only for unauthenticated users.

- The preferred language is Python, though the candidates are free to use any language of their choice.

- Likewise, the candidates are free to use any database of their choice.

- The implementation should be published in GitHub and the link to the GitHub repository should be shared with us.
